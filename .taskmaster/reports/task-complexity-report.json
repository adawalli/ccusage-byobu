			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to cover prerequisite checks, interactive prompts, npm global installation, installation command invocation, shell profile modification, and robust error handling with rollback.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a one-command installer with interactive configuration, environment setup, and rollback on failure involves multiple integration points and error scenarios, adding to complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add Error Handling and Graceful Degradation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to detail handling of command absence, JSON errors, permission issues, network timeouts, and implementation of debug and test modes.",
