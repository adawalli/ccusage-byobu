			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Research and Analyze Existing tmux Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the analysis into subtasks covering code structure review, JSON parsing logic evaluation, cost calculation methods assessment, and visual progress bar implementation examination.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires detailed understanding of existing code and its components, including parsing and UI elements, but is limited to analysis without coding. It involves multiple technical aspects that justify moderate complexity and multiple focused subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Setup NPM Package Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the setup into initializing package.json, creating directory structure and configuration files, and setting up package scripts and dependencies.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up an NPM package is a standard procedure with clear steps, involving configuration and tooling setup, which is straightforward but requires attention to detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Port Core Logic from tmux to Byobu Format",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand on each subtask to include detailed implementation steps, error handling scenarios, and integration testing plans for the Byobu environment.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves adapting complex existing logic from tmux to Byobu, requiring careful handling of command execution, JSON parsing, output formatting, and Unicode progress bars within strict output constraints. The multiple dependencies and need for graceful fallback increase complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Color-Coded Usage Levels",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the color coding logic implementation, environment variable integration, and comprehensive testing across themes and usage scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "While the core logic is straightforward (mapping usage percentages to colors), ensuring compatibility with Byobu's color system, environment variable control, and theme testing adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Add Environment Variable Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to cover environment variable design, validation, pass-through mechanisms, and configuration file support with error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting multiple environment variables with validation, defaults, and pass-through to subtasks requires careful design and robust implementation to avoid configuration errors and ensure flexibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Installation Command Feature",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to include detailed script creation, directory and permission management, refresh interval handling, uninstall logic, and user feedback mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Automating installation with directory checks, permission settings, and uninstall support involves multiple system-level operations and error handling, increasing task complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Handle Multiple Active Sessions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to elaborate on parsing multiple sessions, display strategies, usage metric calculations, and output formatting within UI constraints.",
			"reasoning": "Managing multiple concurrent sessions with aggregation, prioritization, and concise display requires thoughtful data handling and UI logic but is manageable with clear subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Curl Installer Script",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to cover prerequisite checks, interactive prompts, npm global installation, installation command invocation, shell profile modification, and robust error handling with rollback.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a one-command installer with interactive configuration, environment setup, and rollback on failure involves multiple integration points and error scenarios, adding to complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add Error Handling and Graceful Degradation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to detail handling of command absence, JSON errors, permission issues, network timeouts, and implementation of debug and test modes.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling across various failure modes with graceful degradation and debug support is critical and moderately complex due to the breadth of scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Caching",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to include caching strategy design, JSON parsing optimization, lazy loading implementation, and performance profiling with analysis.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization and caching require careful design and profiling but are well-scoped with clear subtasks focused on specific improvements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to cover README creation, environment variable documentation, contributing guide, and inline code documentation with examples and visuals.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation is essential but less technically complex; it requires thoroughness and clarity rather than intricate implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Package and Publish to NPM",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand subtasks to detail package metadata configuration, npm script setup, .npmignore configuration, and publishing workflow testing.",
			"reasoning": "Preparing a package for NPM involves multiple configuration and testing steps to ensure smooth publishing and installation, requiring attention to detail."
