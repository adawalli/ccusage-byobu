		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Research and Analyze Existing tmux Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the analysis into subtasks covering code structure review, JSON parsing logic evaluation, cost calculation methods assessment, and visual progress bar implementation examination.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires detailed understanding of existing code and its components, including parsing and UI elements, but is limited to analysis without coding. It involves multiple technical aspects that justify moderate complexity and multiple focused subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Setup NPM Package Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the setup into initializing package.json, creating directory structure and configuration files, and setting up package scripts and dependencies.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up an NPM package is a standard procedure with clear steps, involving configuration and tooling setup, which is straightforward but requires attention to detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Port Core Logic from tmux to Byobu Format",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for command execution implementation, JSON parsing for active sessions, cost extraction and formatting, progress bar porting, and output formatting for byobu.",
			"reasoning": "Porting core logic involves adapting multiple functional components to a new environment with constraints on output format and behavior, increasing complexity and requiring careful modularization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Color-Coded Usage Levels",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for implementing color coding logic, integrating environment variable control, and testing color rendering across themes.",
			"reasoning": "Color coding is a focused feature with moderate complexity, involving conditional logic and environment configuration, but limited scope overall."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Add Environment Variable Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for supporting each environment variable, validation and defaults, pass-through of core variables, and implementing the --config flag.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting multiple environment variables with validation and integration adds complexity, requiring careful design to ensure flexibility and robustness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Installation Command Feature",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for script creation, directory checks and creation, permission setting, refresh interval support, and uninstall functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Installation scripting involves file system operations, permission management, and user feedback, which are error-prone and require thorough handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Handle Multiple Active Sessions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for parsing multiple sessions, implementing display strategies (most recent, aggregate, rotate), usage metric calculations, and display formatting within limits.",
			"reasoning": "Managing multiple concurrent sessions adds complexity in data handling and UI constraints, requiring thoughtful logic for aggregation and display."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Curl Installer Script",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for prerequisite checks, interactive prompts, global npm installation, invoking installation command, shell profile modification, and error handling with rollback.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a robust installer script with interactive configuration, cross-platform support, and rollback mechanisms is complex and critical for user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add Error Handling and Graceful Degradation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for handling command absence, JSON errors, permission issues, network timeouts, and implementing debug and test modes.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling across multiple failure modes with fallback strategies increases complexity and requires careful design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Caching",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for caching implementation, JSON parsing optimization, lazy loading features, and performance profiling.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization involves multiple technical improvements and profiling, moderately complex but focused on efficiency gains."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for README creation, environment variable documentation, contributing guide, and inline code documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation is essential but less technically complex; it requires thoroughness and clarity rather than technical difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Package and Publish to NPM",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for metadata configuration, npm scripts setup, .npmignore configuration, and publishing workflow testing.",
			"reasoning": "Packaging and publishing require attention to detail and process adherence but follow established patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Host Installer Script and Setup Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for hosting setup, CDN and caching configuration, versioned script management, and monitoring and analytics implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Hosting infrastructure involves multiple components including availability, versioning, and monitoring, adding moderate complexity."
