Key findings:\n\n**Architecture Overview:**\n- Single Node.js script that acts as a tmux status line generator\n- Uses child_process to execute `ccusage` CLI and parse JSON output\n- Compact design with main execution flow: retrieve data → parse → calculate → format → output\n\n**Code Organization:**\n- All functionality in one script file\n- Functions likely inline (no module separation visible)\n- Direct dependency on external `ccusage` CLI tool\n- Uses Node.js built-in modules (child_process)\n\n**Main Components:**\n1. CLI command execution (`ccusage` tool)\n2. JSON parsing logic for usage data\n3. Metrics calculation (remaining minutes, costs, percentages)\n4. Color-coded progress bar generation\n5. tmux status line formatting\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Graceful failure with exit code 1\n- Fallback message for inactive sessions\n\n**Key Insight:** Simple, monolithic structure that could benefit from modularization for the byobu port.\n</info added on 2025-06-23T22:32:32.917Z>",
