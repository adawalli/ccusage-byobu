Key findings:\n\n**Architecture Overview:**\n- Single Node.js script that acts as a tmux status line generator\n- Uses child_process to execute `ccusage` CLI and parse JSON output\n- Compact design with main execution flow: retrieve data → parse → calculate → format → output\n\n**Code Organization:**\n- All functionality in one script file\n- Functions likely inline (no module separation visible)\n- Direct dependency on external `ccusage` CLI tool\n- Uses Node.js built-in modules (child_process)\n\n**Main Components:**\n1. CLI command execution (`ccusage` tool)\n2. JSON parsing logic for usage data\n3. Metrics calculation (remaining minutes, costs, percentages)\n4. Color-coded progress bar generation\n5. tmux status line formatting\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Graceful failure with exit code 1\n- Fallback message for inactive sessions\n\n**Key Insight:** Simple, monolithic structure that could benefit from modularization for the byobu port.\n</info added on 2025-06-23T22:32:32.917Z>",

Optional max keys limit with LRU eviction when limit reached\n3. Configuration object for cache initialization\n4. Environment variable support for cache settings\n5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing usage\n<info added on 2025-06-24T21:36:31.548Z>\nCOMPLETED: Enhanced cache configuration options successfully implemented\n\nImplementation details:\n1. Configurable cleanup interval - Added `cleanupIntervalMs` option (default 30s, configurable via constructor options or CCUSAGE_BYOBU_CACHE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL env var)\n\n2. Optional max keys limit with LRU eviction - Added `maxKeys` option (default null = unlimited, configurable via constructor options or CCUSAGE_BYOBU_CACHE_MAX_KEYS env var). When limit is reached, oldest accessed keys are evicted using LRU strategy.\n\n3. Configuration object support - Cache constructor now accepts options object with validation: cleanupIntervalMs, maxKeys, windowSize, intervalDuration\n\n4. Environment variable support - Added support for:\n   - CCUSAGE_BYOBU_CACHE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL (cleanup interval in ms)\n   - CCUSAGE_BYOBU_CACHE_MAX_KEYS (max keys before LRU eviction)\n   - CCUSAGE_BYOBU_CACHE_WINDOW_SIZE (rolling window size)\n\n5. Backward compatibility maintained - getCache() still works without arguments, all existing code continues to work unchanged\n\nKey implementation details:\n- Added `accessOrder` Map to track LRU order efficiently\n- Enhanced all cache operations (set, get, has, cleanup, clear) to maintain LRU ordering\n- Added new `lruEvictions` stat to track LRU-specific evictions separately\n- Configuration precedence: defaults < environment variables < constructor options\n- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for new features\n- All tests pass: basic functionality, LRU eviction, environment variables\n\nThe cache is now much more flexible and production-ready with configurable limits and cleanup behavior.\n</info added on 2025-06-24T21:36:31.548Z>",
